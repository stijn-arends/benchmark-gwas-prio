One of the things that PoPs requires are raw feature files, which can be found [here](https://github.com/FinucaneLab/gene_features.git). The [download_features.sh](download_features.sh) and [rename_file_contents.py](rename_file_contents.py) scripts can be used to download and process all the files so that they can be used to run PoPs.

To download and process the raw features run the [download_features.sh](download_features.sh) script:

```bash
bash download_features.sh
```

The raw features will be downloaded and placed in a new directory inside the current working directory.

> WARNING: the raw features are large files so make sure that there is enough storage.
